        Temple University is a community of{" "}
        <strong>individuals who truly show up everyday to learn. </strong> It's
        one of the reasons that I was so interested in the field I'm in now.
        Everyone at Temple is there to help and I'm no better example of that. I
        was able to blossom into a young adult with strong communication skills
        and got to diversify my knowledge with never-ending extracurricular
        activities.

        Every year that I was at this University I felt like I was a completely
        different person. This allowed me to get my feet wet into server's
        different fields before even completing my 4-year degree.
        <br /> The school was everything that I could have ever wanted from{" "}
        <strong>'the college experience'.</strong> A truly diverse student body,
        along with dedicated professors to guide you into the real world as a
        professional in your major.
        <br /> They include a massive alumni network, while also providing an
        above average platform for employment through the University's career
        center.

        <strong>The Students</strong>
      </h1>
      <p className="large-font">
        One of my favorite parts of attending Temple University was that so many
        of the students were dedicated about their education and willingly
        shared knowledge between one another. Everyone is there to learn and
        improve themselves. It's mostly unspoken, yet respected. I've made
        countless lifetime friends here and hope to make many more.
