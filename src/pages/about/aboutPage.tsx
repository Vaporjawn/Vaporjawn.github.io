                          I'm a passionate developer focused on building
                          interactive experiences, performant web interfaces,
                          and accessible user journeys. I love working across
                          the stack, experimenting with visual effects, and
                          refining details that make digital products feel
                          polished and intentional.

                      Outside of coding, I explore creative tech, gaming
                      culture, design systems, and ways to elevate personal
                      digital identity. This site evolves as an experimental
                      canvasâ€”showcasing projects, iterations, and ideas in
                      motion.
