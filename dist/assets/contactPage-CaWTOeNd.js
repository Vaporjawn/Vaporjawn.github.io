I specialize in modern web technologies and can help with everything from MVP development to scaling existing applications.",category:"services"},{question:"What is your typical development process and how are clients involved?",answer:"My development process follows four key phases: Discovery (understanding requirements and technical scope), Planning (architecture design and timeline estimation), Development (iterative development with regular check-ins), and Delivery (testing, deployment, and handover). Clients are involved throughout with regular updates, demo sessions, and feedback incorporation.",category:"process"},{question:"What are your pricing models and payment terms?",answer:"I offer three main pricing tiers: Consultation ($500) for technical advice and code reviews, Development ($2000) for feature development and bug fixes, and Project Leadership ($5000) for comprehensive project management and architecture. Payment terms are typically 50% upfront and 50% on completion, with flexible arrangements for longer projects.",category:"pricing"},{question:"Which technologies do you specialize in for Full-Stack Development?",answer:"Frontend: React, TypeScript, Material-UI, modern CSS, responsive design.

I focus on modern, maintainable technologies that provide long-term value and excellent developer experience.",category:"technical"},{question:"Can you help with an existing project or only new ones? What about project rescue?",answer:"I work with both new and existing projects. For existing projects, I can help with feature additions, performance optimization, code refactoring, and technical debt reduction. I also specialize in project rescue situations - taking over stalled projects, fixing critical issues, and getting development back on track.",category:"projects"},{question:"How do I get started on a project with you, and what's the initial consultation like?",answer:"Getting started is simple: reach out via email, LinkedIn, or schedule a call. The initial consultation is a 30-minute discussion where we'll review your project goals, technical requirements, timeline, and budget. I'll provide honest feedback about feasibility and approach, and if we're a good fit, I'll create a detailed project proposal.",category:"getting-started"},{question:"Do you offer ongoing support and maintenance, and what are the terms?",answer:"Yes, I offer ongoing support and maintenance packages. This includes bug fixes, security updates, performance monitoring, and feature enhancements. Support terms are typically on a retainer basis or hourly rate, depending on the project scope and client needs. I believe in long-term partnerships with my clients.",category:"support"},{question:"What kind of technical consulting do you provide, and how can it benefit my project's timeline and budget?",answer:"Technical consulting includes architecture review, performance optimization, technology stack selection, code review, and team mentoring. This can significantly benefit your timeline by identifying potential issues early, optimizing development processes, and ensuring best practices. It often saves money by preventing costly rewrites and technical debt.",category:"consulting"},{question:"How are project timelines estimated, and what happens if there are delays?",answer:"Timelines are estimated based on detailed requirement analysis, technical complexity assessment, and my experience with similar projects. I provide realistic estimates with buffer time for unexpected challenges. If delays occur, I communicate immediately with revised timelines and mitigation strategies. Most delays are avoided through proper planning and regular check-ins.",category:"timeline"},{question:"What are the terms regarding intellectual property (IP) ownership for the developed software?",answer:"Generally, clients retain full intellectual property rights to custom-developed software. I retain rights to any pre-existing tools, frameworks, or general methodologies I bring to the project. All IP terms are clearly defined in the project contract before work begins, ensuring transparency and protection for both parties.",category:"legal"},{question:"How do you handle changes in project scope or requirements (scope creep)?",answer:"Scope changes are handled through a formal change request process. I document the requested changes, assess their impact on timeline and budget, and provide a written amendment for approval. Small changes may be absorbed, but significant changes require project plan updates. Clear communication and documentation prevent scope creep issues.",category:"scope"}];return e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:[e.jsx(A,{title:"Contact - Let's Work Together",description:"Have a project in mind?
