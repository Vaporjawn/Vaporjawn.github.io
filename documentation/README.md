# Hey Victor

you're doing good so far keep it up 

add to this later :)

it's going to be so nice to have a directory where i can randomly access an array and then use it for random blog post 

I will also be able to list the blog posts with the same array from the gist so blog-list.html will be taken care of soon

    Basically I can import the Title Date and Time (along with other variables down the line) and make them show on the front end list without having to use react :)

I want to make a more generalized readFile function so taht I can use it to show the data elsewhere. but so far it already produces the array that i need

nice directory btw

## Adding to the directory

1. create the Title, Date, and Time in the respective locations on the HTML file
2. Make sure the dateFormat(); script at the bottom of the page is disabled for this
3. Enable the Save button (exists on older pages by default commented out)
4. HIT SAVE!
5. Profit by checking your gist.github.com to see if the changes went through to the library file

TODO: Change the pointer CSS so that onclick is matching the href css in blogpost

maybe store a user's post history in local storage

next thing to do is insert the image addresses into the index with javascript
