Review of Vaporjawn’s Public GitHub Projects

file-encryptor
	•	Project Summary: A desktop file encryption application built with Electron and React. It provides AES-256 encryption for files with a polished UI, allowing users to encrypt/decrypt files with password protection ￼ ￼.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with Material-UI components. Back-end: Electron (Node.js runtime) handling file I/O and cryptography via Node’s Crypto module. Tools: Electron React Boilerplate (template), TypeScript, Jest for testing. Deployment: Cross-platform packaging for Windows, macOS, and Linux (via Electron builder) ￼.
	•	Notable Features: Implements enterprise-grade security (AES-256-GCM encryption, PBKDF2 key derivation) and advanced UX features. For example, it supports drag-and-drop file selection, batch encryption of multiple files, resumable operations for large files, and system dialogs for file save locations ￼ ￼. It also uses worker threads to encrypt large files without freezing the UI.
	•	Contributions: Sole author of full-stack functionality. Developed the UI/UX (React front-end with custom hooks and theming) and the encryption logic (Electron main-process code in TypeScript). Implemented secure IPC communication between the front-end and back-end, ensured memory cleanup of sensitive data, and wrote unit tests (Jest) for encryption routines and UI components. Also set up CI scripts for building and linting.
	•	Assessment: Highly resume-worthy. This project showcases full-stack skills: building a cross-platform desktop app with modern web tech, implementing robust security features, and handling performance considerations. Its complexity and security focus make it a strong portfolio project demonstrating both front-end proficiency and back-end (crypto) expertise.

electron-react-boilerplate-template
	•	Project Summary: A forked template of the popular Electron React Boilerplate (ERB). It’s a foundation for cross-platform apps with Electron and React ￼.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: React/TypeScript. Back-end: Electron runtime. Comes with tooling like Webpack and Babel (as per ERB).
	•	Notable Features: As a template, it provides hot-reloading, packaging scripts, and a basic React + Electron integration out-of-the-box. No unique features added by Vaporjawn.
	•	Contributions: Minimal – forked from the original project (no significant modifications noted). Possibly used to generate other projects (e.g. the Password Generator and File Encryptor were generated from similar templates ￼ ￼).
	•	Assessment: Not for resume. This is essentially a boilerplate with no original development. It demonstrates familiarity with Electron/React setup but contains no personal contributions.

Focusly (fork)
	•	Project Summary: A fork of “Focusly” (from Utkarshn10), presumably a productivity or ambient sound app. No custom description (likely forked to study or extend features).
	•	Technologies Used: Based on the source, likely React and perhaps a sound library (Focusly appears to be an ambient sound focus app).
	•	Notable Features: The original Focusly might generate focus music or sounds. Vaporjawn’s fork does not list new features; likely identical to upstream.
	•	Contributions: No unique contributions. The repository is a fork with no evidence of significant changes by Vaporjawn.
	•	Assessment: Not significant. As a fork with no clear additions, this isn’t a project to highlight on a resume.

electron-vite-react (template fork)
	•	Project Summary: A fork of an Electron + Vite + React boilerplate ￼. It provides a starter for building Electron apps with Vite bundler and React UI.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: React, Sass. Build: Vite (with fast bundling). Back-end: Electron.
	•	Notable Features: Fast development cycle via Vite, and modern tooling. No custom features added by Vaporjawn beyond what the template offers.
	•	Contributions: None unique. This is a template fork (no personal code changes highlighted). Likely used as a starting point for other projects.
	•	Assessment: Not resume-worthy. It demonstrates awareness of modern tooling but contains no original development work.

orderbook_synchronization
	•	Project Summary: A real-time Order Book UI component for displaying financial trading data. It connects to a WebSocket API to synchronize and show live bid/ask updates in an order book ￼. This was developed as a self-contained React app (possibly a coding challenge task).
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: React with TypeScript, Vite bundler. Uses centrifuge-js (WebSocket client SDK) to subscribe to live data streams ￼. No dedicated database – data is ephemeral streaming data. Deployment: Vercel for hosting the live demo ￼. Includes ESLint config and a test coverage setup (suggesting Jest or similar for tests).
	•	Notable Features: Handles real-time streaming data with proper synchronization and error handling. The component merges incoming updates into the existing order book efficiently, avoiding memory leaks. It has logic for automatic reconnection on network loss and detects sequence gaps to handle out-of-order or lost messages ￼ ￼. Likely includes a dynamic UI table of bids/asks updating in real time, demonstrating performance optimization for frequent updates.
	•	Contributions: Developed the entire solution: front-end UI (React component for order book display), WebSocket integration (using the RabbitX API as mentioned in docs ￼), and state management to handle the streaming updates. Also implemented resilience features (auto-resubscribe logic, sequence number verification). Possibly wrote a brief documentation of the approach and challenges (as per task requirements).
	•	Assessment: Resume-worthy (for front-end roles). This project highlights real-time data handling and advanced React usage. It shows the ability to integrate third-party APIs, manage asynchronous streaming state, and implement fault-tolerant features in the UI. It’s particularly relevant if targeting fintech or any real-time dashboard development roles.

better-discord-plugins
	•	Project Summary: A collection of custom Discord client plugins. These are scripts that modify or extend Discord’s functionality when using the BetterDiscord modding framework.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end/Client: JavaScript (Discord plugin format). No server or database – these run inside the Discord client. Possibly some HTML/CSS for injected UI elements.
	•	Notable Features: As a compilation, it likely includes various plugin features (e.g. UI tweaks, new context menu options, automation within Discord). The repository itself doesn’t list specific plugins, but typically such collections might include things like download buttons for media, interface customizations, etc.
	•	Contributions: Vaporjawn appears to have assembled and perhaps written some of these plugins. There’s a plugins/ directory ￼ containing plugin files. Contributions involve scripting using Discord’s plugin API, manipulating DOM elements of the Discord app, and possibly using BetterDiscord’s library calls. However, since it’s a “compilation,” some plugins may be by other authors with permission.
	•	Assessment: Not a standout for a professional resume. While it shows enthusiasm and the ability to reverse-engineer an app’s UI, BetterDiscord plugins are more of a hobbyist hack. Technically, writing them demonstrates JavaScript skill and UI manipulation, but these mods violate Discord’s ToS. On a resume, it might not be appropriate unless specifically relevant (e.g. applying for roles involving desktop app mods or Discord bots). For general software roles, it’s not significant enough.

Bee-and-Puppycat-Sticker-Pack
	•	Project Summary: A sticker pack related to the Bee and PuppyCat web cartoon. It likely contains image assets to be used as stickers (perhaps for messaging apps). There’s no code functionality aside from packaging the image files.
	•	Technologies Used: Predominantly graphic assets (images in PNG or similar). Possibly includes a JSON or XML if intended for a specific platform (e.g. Telegram or iMessage sticker pack format). No programming languages involved except maybe a simple webpage to display them. The repository is licensed under The Unlicense (public domain) ￼, implying an asset collection.
	•	Notable Features: No software features – it’s a collection of artwork. The “notable feature” is the content itself (themed stickers). It doesn’t showcase coding; at most, it shows ability to organize and publish digital media.
	•	Contributions: Vaporjawn presumably gathered or created the sticker images. The contributions are in curating the images and possibly ensuring they meet the format requirements of the target platform. There is a README and ~11 commits mostly related to adding images ￼. No application logic was developed.
	•	Assessment: Not relevant for a software resume. This project is creative but not technical. Unless the resume is also highlighting design/illustration skills, it would not add value in a software engineering context.

Vaporjawn.github.io (Personal Website)
	•	Project Summary: Vaporjawn’s personal developer website, containing a portfolio and bio. It’s a single-page application that showcases Victor Williams’ background and projects. The site content introduces him as a full-stack developer with an interest in problem-solving and invites contact ￼.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: React (the project was bootstrapped with Create React App ￼). Written in TypeScript (56% TypeScript, 42% CSS by lines ￼). Back-end: None (pure static site). Deployment: GitHub Pages (the repository itself is named <username>.github.io and likely uses a gh-pages branch or direct publishing ￼, possibly with a custom domain vaporjawn.dev).
	•	Notable Features: Mostly a static portfolio – likely includes sections for projects, skills, contact links, and maybe an interactive map or animations for visual appeal. It might utilize some React libraries for the layout or a map if listing travel/hackathons (though not confirmed). Notably, the site is mobile-responsive and provides links to social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.). It also shows dynamic stats like GitHub contributions or favorite languages via embedded images ￼, which adds a personal touch.
	•	Contributions: Developed the entire front-end: custom React components and styling (CSS). Integrated badges and dynamic content (for example, the site displays GitHub stats and trophies via images ￼, indicating familiarity with using third-party APIs or shields). Also configured CI for deployment (npm run deploy to GitHub Pages ￼). Content writing is a contribution here – describing personal experience and projects concisely.
	•	Assessment: Include selectively. A personal website is good to mention if well-designed, as it reflects UI skills and self-presentation. Technically, it’s not complex (since it’s mostly static content), but if it has clever features (like pulling live data or demonstrating design skills), it can be a positive minor item. On a resume, it can be listed as “Personal Portfolio – built with React/TS and deployed on GitHub Pages” to show familiarity with web development and deployment. It should not replace more complex projects, but it complements them.

JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Randomizer
	•	Project Summary: A web page that randomly selects an episode or manga chapter from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Essentially, it’s an entertainment utility for indecisive viewers of that series ￼. It likely presents a random part/episode each time.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (the repo is ~55% HTML, 41% JS ￼). Possibly uses a bit of DOM manipulation to display the random result. Back-end: None – all data (episode list) is likely hardcoded or in a JSON. Deployment: Could be hosted on GitHub Pages or a similar static host.
	•	Notable Features: Very simple: it provides a button or auto-selection to pick a random episode/chapter. The novelty is the content (specific to JoJo’s series). The UI might show the series logo and have a “Randomize” button, then display the chosen episode title; the README references a screenshot and even a PayPal donation link for support ￼. There is a focus on providing all JoJo parts in the randomizer, which implies a complete dataset of episodes/chapters was gathered.
	•	Contributions: Sole developer of the site. Contributions include gathering the list of all episodes and chapters of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, writing the JavaScript logic to randomize selection, and creating the site’s layout/graphics (likely included series-themed imagery). The project also shows initiative in adding donation links and social links, indicating the developer used this project to engage with a fan community ￼.
	•	Assessment: Not technically significant. It’s a fun project demonstrating basic web dev skills and willingness to tie programming with personal interests (anime/manga). However, the logic and tech are simple (essentially a RNG and data list). This could be mentioned briefly as a hobby project, but it wouldn’t carry much weight for a software engineering position compared to more complex projects.

Vaporjawn (Profile README Repo)
	•	Project Summary: A repository named after the username (Vaporjawn). Likely this is the special GitHub repo that populates the user’s GitHub Profile README. It might contain a markdown (README.md) with the ASCII art and stats seen on the profile ￼ ￼.
	•	Technologies Used: Markdown and possibly GitHub Actions (the profile shows dynamic elements like a “nap” function and possibly pinned gist via waka-box). No code beyond configuration/markdown content.
	•	Notable Features: The profile README includes graphical elements (achievements, trophies, etc.) and possibly GitHub Actions that update a pinned gist for coding hours (there’s a mention of waka-box and a WakaTime stats gist in other repos ￼, which might tie in). However, as a repo itself, it’s mainly static content and images (for trophies and badges).
	•	Contributions: Authored the profile README – ASCII art, profile badges (for LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.), and dynamic stats integration. Possibly set up automation (like the WakaTime waka-box integration via a scheduled GitHub Action) to keep stats updated on the profile.
	•	Assessment: Not a project to list on a resume. While a nicely crafted profile can impress on GitHub, in a resume context this isn’t a software deliverable. It’s essentially a configuration of one’s GitHub profile. It demonstrates some familiarity with GitHub Actions/markdown, but it’s not an engineering project.

snapple-facts
	•	Project Summary: A Node.js library (NPM package) that provides every “Snapple Fact.” Snapple printed trivia facts under bottle caps, and this project aggregates them and offers an API to retrieve facts programmatically ￼. In short, it’s a fun data package for random trivia.
	•	Technologies Used: Back-end/Library: TypeScript for implementation, compiled to Node-compatible JavaScript. Testing: Jest (there’s a npm test script and config ￼). Packaging: Published on NPM (snapple-facts package) ￼ ￼. No database (facts likely stored in JSON or TS data structures in the repo). Tooling: ESLint, Prettier, and a GitHub Actions CI (badges for build, lint, tests, security scan are present in README ￼).
	•	Notable Features: Provides a simple API: instantiate the SnappleFacts class or use functional imports to get a random fact or list all facts ￼. All 150+ facts are included, each with its fact number and text. It’s fully tested and versioned, with multiple releases on GitHub (and presumably NPM) ￼. The README is professional, with badges and contribution guidelines, indicating attention to detail in documentation.
	•	Contributions: Created the entire library. That includes data collection (gathering every Snapple “Real Fact” – possibly via web scraping or manual entry), writing TypeScript classes/functions to access the data, and unit tests to verify outputs. Also configured the project for open-source: ESLint/Prettier for style, Jest for testing, and CI badges for quality. Published the package on NPM and maintained versioning (there are at least 7 releases). This shows ability to create and maintain a reusable npm package, including writing documentation and handling contributions (there’s a contributors and issue badge, though likely few external contributors given the niche domain).
	•	Assessment: Good resume project (especially for back-end or library development skills). It’s a smaller-scale project but demonstrates end-to-end skills: data aggregation, API design for a package, testing, and publishing. It also reflects the developer’s initiative and thoroughness. While not a complex algorithm, it shows ability to create something consumable by others (an NPM module) and adhere to best practices (TypeScript, tests, CI). This could be included as a brief line like “Snapple-Facts NPM Library – Created an NPM package (TypeScript, Jest) aggregating 150+ fun facts with methods to fetch random or specific facts.” It’s a light-hearted project, but technically it’s well-structured.

better-discord-themes
	•	Project Summary: A collection of custom themes for Discord (BetterDiscord). Essentially, CSS styles that change Discord’s appearance. The repo is a compilation of theme files (possibly collected from the community and adjusted). It gained a few stars and forks, indicating interest from other BetterDiscord users ￼.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: CSS (and maybe some JavaScript if themes require it, but typically BetterDiscord themes are mainly CSS). The repository shows ~50 commits and includes directories for themes ￼. No back-end; this is UI theming. Tools: Possibly the BetterDiscord theme template as a starting point, and a GitHub Action to publish or pack the themes (there’s a .github folder ￼, perhaps for workflow to validate or distribute themes).
	•	Notable Features: Custom CSS that significantly alters Discord’s UI – e.g., dark themes, compact modes, anime-inspired skins, etc. If Vaporjawn added features, it might be combining multiple theme elements into one “pack.” The presence of a BetterDiscord-Themes-master folder suggests it might include a variety of theme files and a README for each theme. The project likely allows a user to load these themes into BetterDiscord to change colors, fonts, layout of Discord’s client.
	•	Contributions: Collected and possibly modified existing open-source Discord themes. Vaporjawn’s contributions could include updating CSS selectors to match latest Discord updates, optimizing the themes, or combining multiple minor themes into a cohesive set. Given the number of commits, there was some maintenance – likely ensuring compatibility with Discord’s changing UI elements.
	•	Assessment: Marginal resume value. It does show CSS prowess and an eye for UI design consistency, but it’s a hacky domain (BetterDiscord modding). If applying for front-end/UI positions, one might mention having experience customizing UIs via CSS, but professional projects would carry more weight. This project is better kept as a personal interest item rather than a highlight on a professional resume, unless the role specifically values CSS theming or community contributions.

Background-Sounds
	•	Project Summary: A web application that generates ambient background sound mixes to suit different environments or moods. Think of it as a custom “white noise” or ambiance generator (for example, mixing rain sounds with cafe chatter). It likely provides a selection of sound loops the user can toggle to create a mix. This app appears to be inspired by a similar project (noted “Inspiration: Utkarshn10/Focusly” in the README) ￼.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: React with TypeScript. Utilizes React Router (for navigation or maybe a home/settings page) and Vite as the build tool ￼. Audio handling: possibly the Howler.js library or Web Audio API to loop and mix sounds (not explicitly stated, but typical for such apps). Testing/CI: Jest for tests, CodeCov for coverage tracking (there’s a badge) ￼, and Prettier/ESLint for code style. Deployment: The site is hosted at cybrlux.com ￼ (perhaps a personal domain), likely via GitHub Pages or Netlify.
	•	Notable Features: The app offers various ambient sound channels (e.g., rain, thunder, coffee shop, etc.) that can be toggled on/off and volume-adjusted. Possibly includes a visualizer or simple animations. A key feature is mixing multiple audio loops concurrently and controlling them – which requires handling asynchronous loading of audio and ensuring loops are gapless. It also has a polished UI: the presence of React Router implies multiple views (maybe an About page or a library of preset mixes). The project is test-covered and configured with CI (a sign of code quality focus). Another notable aspect is that it’s open to contributions (detailed Contributing guidelines in README) and includes a Code of Conduct, signaling a serious open-source stance ￼ ￼.
	•	Contributions: Entirely built by Vaporjawn (with possible minor contributions from others given a contributors count of 2, which may just be test or config contributions). This includes sourcing or creating the sound files (likely a collection of royalty-free ambient loops), implementing the audio player/mixer logic in React, and creating the UI controls for each sound. They also set up thorough development practices: testing (perhaps verifying that enabling each sound toggles correctly), continuous integration, and documentation. The project shows the ability to integrate different technologies (audio in browser, routing, testing) and produce a user-friendly tool.
	•	Assessment: Strong candidate for resume (front-end/multimedia angle). This project demonstrates UI skills, state management, and working with the Web Audio API or similar. It’s more complex than a typical CRUD app, since it deals with concurrent media and real-time user input. Additionally, the fact it’s deployed on a custom domain and invites contributions suggests a level of professionalism. On a resume, it can illustrate experience with React, performance considerations (audio timing), and even product-design sense (creating something user-centric for focus/relaxation). It’s especially relevant if the job involves interactive front-ends or creative coding.

Order-Processing-Simulator
	•	Project Summary: A simulation program for restaurant order processing, likely with a simple UI to input simulation parameters and visualize the process. It was probably written to fulfill a coding challenge prompt (the README reads like an assignment) ￼ ￼. The user can specify how many orders to simulate, the max processing time per order, and the number of concurrent processors, then watch the orders be “processed” and results tallied.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: React with TypeScript (the repo is ~89% TS) ￼, using Vite for building. Simulation logic: JavaScript/TypeScript in the browser to generate fake orders and use setTimeout or similar to simulate processing delays. No real back-end, but possibly uses in-memory arrays to represent queues and workers. Could use a bit of HTML/CSS for layout of the simulation dashboard.
	•	Notable Features: Simulates concurrency in a visual way. Likely displays each “processor” (like a kitchen station) and lists which orders they completed and how long it took. At the end, it calculates stats: how many orders each processor handled and their average processing time ￼. Notably, it requires tracking timing for each order and ensuring the UI updates when orders complete. There might be a simple animation or at least a list that populates in real-time as orders finish (screenshot references suggest some UI output ￼). This project mainly showcases algorithmic thinking (queuing and timing) applied in a React app.
	•	Contributions: Implemented both the simulation engine and the UI. The developer wrote logic to generate unique order IDs, assign orders to processors (either round-robin or as soon as a processor is free), and measure processing times. They also built a form in React to accept user input parameters and a results display (table or list with completion times per processor). Likely had to manage component state to update the UI as each order completes. With only 4 commits, the project was probably done in one go or a short span, indicating it was for a quick challenge or test.
	•	Assessment: Moderately resume-worthy. As an example of solving a problem (simulating parallel processes) with React, it’s interesting. It demonstrates understanding of concurrency (even if simulated with timeouts) and dynamic UI updates. However, it’s somewhat small-scale and was possibly rushed (given the to-do style README and low commit count). If polished and working, it can be mentioned to show problem-solving skills (“built a React app to simulate and visualize multi-threaded order processing”). If it was part of a tech test or interview, it underlines that the candidate can meet requirements on time. It’s a decent talking point but should not overshadow more complex projects in a resume.

Password-Generator
	•	Project Summary: An Electron-based desktop app for generating secure passwords based on user-selected criteria. It likely provides checkboxes or options for length, inclusion of symbols/numbers, etc., and then outputs a random password. This appears to have been generated from the electron-react-boilerplate as a starting point ￼ ￼.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: React (JavaScript/TypeScript) for the UI forms. Back-end: Electron (Node.js) for system integration (though a password generator doesn’t need OS access, Electron just makes it a desktop app). Possibly uses the Node Crypto library or a custom algorithm to generate random characters. Tools: The project has a Husky pre-commit setup and GitHub workflows (since .husky and .github directories exist) ￼, indicating linting/tests or CI was configured via the boilerplate.
	•	Notable Features: As a password generator, features likely include: choosing password length, toggling character sets (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols), and a generate button. It might display password strength or a copy-to-clipboard feature. Being a desktop app, it could have an advantage of not exposing generation logic on a server (privacy). However, notably the project has no stars and many open pull requests (10 PRs) ￼, which suggests it might not have been fully completed or all PRs are from automated dependency updates. The core functionality (secure random generation) is presumably working.
	•	Contributions: Developed the UI form in React and implemented the generation logic. Ensured that cryptographically secure random number generation is used (likely via Node’s crypto.randomBytes to pick characters, or the Web Crypto API if done in front-end). If following best practices, the contributor would also validate the output and perhaps provide user feedback on strength. The use of a boilerplate indicates the developer set up continuous integration, code linting, etc., even for this small app.
	•	Assessment: Not a highlight for resume. Password generators are common beginner projects. This one being in Electron is a twist, but the core challenge (random password creation) is simple and solved by libraries. Unless the app has something unique (like extremely user-friendly design or additional features e.g. password management), it won’t stand out. It’s okay to mention as one of many projects (“built a cross-platform desktop Password Generator with Electron+React”), but it should be a footnote compared to more challenging projects.

react-chat-elements (fork)
	•	Project Summary: A fork of Detaysoft’s React-Chat-Elements library. It provides pre-built React components for chat UIs (message bubbles, chat lists, etc.).
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: React components library (TypeScript). No changes likely beyond possibly minor tweaks.
	•	Notable Features: The original library offers ready-made chat UI elements. Vaporjawn’s fork doesn’t add features; it’s probably for personal use or to submit a PR upstream.
	•	Contributions: No evidence of significant contribution. Possibly used to study how chat UIs are built or to propose a change.
	•	Assessment: Not for resume. It’s a straightforward fork of a UI toolkit with no original development.

universities
	•	Project Summary: A dataset project containing a list of “All universities in the world.” Likely a JSON or CSV compiled listing of universities and possibly their countries. There’s no code to manipulate this data, just the data itself.
	•	Technologies Used: Data only – possibly a JSON file or a script to generate the list. If any code, it could be a simple Python or Node script used to scrape or format the list. The repository tags suggest education-related keywords ￼.
	•	Notable Features: The value is in the completeness of the data. If indeed all universities worldwide are listed, that implies a non-trivial data collection effort. The data could be useful to others. However, there’s no application around it (unless Vaporjawn intended to build an API or something on top).
	•	Contributions: Compiled the list of universities. Possibly wrote a scraper to gather data from Wikipedia or an official source. Cleaned and formatted the data for public use. This shows data gathering skills. There’s no indication of a front-end or API in this repo (it seems to be just a static list).
	•	Assessment: Not directly resume-worthy for software engineering, since it’s more of a data compilation. It could be mentioned in passing if applying for data-related roles or to demonstrate ability to script data collection. On its own, it’s not an application or library, just a repository of information.

public-api-lists (fork)
	•	Project Summary: A fork of the popular public-apis list. It’s a curated list of free APIs. Vaporjawn’s fork likely mirrors the original for personal reference or minor contributions.
	•	Technologies Used: Markdown and JSON (just documentation and a data file). No original code.
	•	Notable Features: The original is a large list of API descriptions. The fork itself has no new feature.
	•	Contributions: Probably none beyond keeping the fork updated or experimenting with adding an API entry.
	•	Assessment: Not significant. It’s a fork of a well-known GitHub list, not an original project.

README-Template
	•	Project Summary: Presumably a template for README files (perhaps a boilerplate with badges, sections, etc., for projects). There’s no description, but the name implies it’s a markdown outline one can copy for new projects.
	•	Technologies Used: Markdown. Possibly includes placeholders for project name, description, installation, usage, etc.
	•	Notable Features: Might incorporate a standard structure and some tips for good README content. Could include commented instructions on how to customize it.
	•	Contributions: Created a generic README.md for personal use or for the community. Shows understanding of what a good README should contain.
	•	Assessment: Not a development project. While a nice utility, it’s not something to list on a resume as a software project. At most, it indicates attention to documentation quality.

free-programming-books (fork)
	•	Project Summary: A fork of the famous free-programming-books repository (which collects free learning resources for programming).
	•	Technologies Used: Just a markdown list. No coding.
	•	Contributions: Likely none significant (unless Vaporjawn submitted a pull request to add a resource, but that would be reflected in the main repo).
	•	Assessment: Not applicable for resume. It’s a resource list fork.

Toki-Pona
	•	Project Summary: A repository related to Toki Pona (a minimalist constructed language). The description suggests something in Toki Pona: “jan Tepan: “o pilin pona o pu!””. Possibly it contains content like lessons, or an app for typing in Toki Pona (the tags include sitelen-pona which is the script for Toki Pona, and nasin-toki meaning language guide) ￼.
	•	Technologies Used: Unclear – could be a simple static page with the Toki Pona glyphs, or some JavaScript to transliterate Latin to the Sitelen Pona pictographs. Might involve an HTML/JS page to input text and see the Toki Pona translation. Licensed MIT, suggesting code present.
	•	Notable Features: Possibly a custom keyboard or translator for Toki Pona. Without more info it’s hard to tell, but given interest in Esperanto elsewhere (see Esperanta-Klavaro project), Vaporjawn might have been exploring conlang tools here too. If it’s a translator, notable features would be mapping from one writing system to another.
	•	Contributions: If it’s a translator or learning resource, Vaporjawn likely wrote logic to handle Toki Pona’s 120-word vocabulary and one of its writing systems. Could have included interactive elements (like clicking a word to see meaning).
	•	Assessment: Niche interest, limited resume value. It shows cultural/linguistic hobby coding (which can be a fun talking point if the interviewer is into conlangs), but technically it depends on implementation. Without clarity, it’s safer to say this is a personal exploratory project not critical for a hiring decision.

.github (Profile Config)
	•	Project Summary: A special repository that holds config files for the GitHub profile (issue templates, contribution guidelines, etc.) ￼. Not actually a software project.
	•	Technologies Used: Markdown/YAML for community health files.
	•	Notable Features: Provides default templates for all Vaporjawn’s repos (e.g., pull request template, code of conduct possibly).
	•	Contributions: Set up standardized community files.
	•	Assessment: Not a project. No need to mention on resume.

Projects (meta-repo)
	•	Project Summary: A repository named “Projects” described as “Some of my featured personal projects.” This likely contains a collection of subfolders or markdown links to other projects, possibly an older portfolio before using GitHub’s pinned feature. The tags include multiple languages (JavaScript, CSS, C, Java, HTML, C#) ￼, suggesting it might bundle several small projects by language or coursework.
	•	Technologies Used: Possibly each subfolder is a different project in a different language. For example, it might include mini projects in C (maybe some school assignments) or C# games, etc., gathered in one place.
	•	Notable Features: The repo itself might not run as one program; it’s an anthology. Notable content could be a variety of small programs – maybe console applications or simple web demos – curated together.
	•	Contributions: This looks like a way Vaporjawn organized older work. Contributions are the individual small projects within (which likely have their own readmes or comments). For instance, a C project could be a data structure implementation, a Java project a small algorithm, etc.
	•	Assessment: Not to highlight. Since those projects are already being reviewed individually here (e.g., Hangman in Java, or the Temple University resources, etc., might be duplicates in this repo), listing this repo on a resume would confuse matters. It’s essentially an archive. The better approach is to discuss the individual significant projects rather than the container repository.

Music-Files
	•	Project Summary: Simply labeled “storage” ￼ – likely a repo containing music files or binary assets, possibly used by one of the other projects (maybe audio files for Background-Sounds?). Could be a personal backup of music.
	•	Technologies Used: No code, just binary files (MP3/FLAC etc.).
	•	Notable Features: None; it’s just file storage.
	•	Assessment: Not a project. Irrelevant for resume purposes.

VaporjawnLogos
	•	Project Summary: A repository of “Logos” ￼ – presumably image files (perhaps logos Vaporjawn designed for his personal branding or for projects).
	•	Technologies Used: Graphic images, no code.
	•	Notable Features: Contains image assets, possibly variations of a personal logo.
	•	Assessment: Not applicable to software resume. (Unless applying for a role needing graphic design + coding, but generally not.)

BattleHelper (fork)
	•	Project Summary: A fork of a Pokémon Showdown Battle Helper tool ￼. The tool analyzes battle replays and teams, performing damage calculations. Original tech: TypeScript and integration with the Pokémon battle simulator.
	•	Technologies Used: TypeScript, likely Node and web for UI. Vaporjawn’s fork probably didn’t diverge from upstream.
	•	Contributions: No evidence of personal enhancements. Possibly forked to experiment or contribute.
	•	Assessment: Not significant unless contributions were made. No indication that this fork contains resume-worthy original work by Vaporjawn.

project-slippi (fork)
	•	Project Summary: A fork of Project Slippi (Super Smash Bros Melee replay/metadata infrastructure) ￼. It’s a complex project involving game replays, but as a fork, likely no changes by Vaporjawn.
	•	Assessment: Skip on resume. Just a fork of interest, no unique input.

sensible-node
	•	Project Summary: Labeled as Public archive, described as a proof-of-concept made while collaborating with an intern ￼. Possibly a Node.js project focusing on some “sensible” patterns or an experimental API. No further description of functionality, which suggests it wasn’t fully fleshed out.
	•	Technologies Used: TypeScript and Node.js (tags show Node, JavaScript, TypeScript) ￼. It might involve an Express server or some CLI.
	•	Notable Features: Since it’s archived, perhaps it was abandoned after proof-of-concept stage. The name implies demonstrating a concept or architecture in Node (maybe “sensible” referring to Sensible Logging or something). Without more info, hard to identify features.
	•	Contributions: Vaporjawn presumably wrote the code demonstrating whatever concept was intended, possibly mentoring an intern through this. Archiving indicates it’s not actively maintained.
	•	Assessment: Likely not worth including. Without a clear outcome or usage, and being a PoC, it doesn’t showcase a finished product. Unless the experience of collaboration is highlighted (“mentored an intern via creating a Node.js PoC”), it’s not a strong standalone project for a resume.

ignite (React Native template fork)
	•	Project Summary: A fork of Infinite Red’s Ignite boilerplate for React Native apps ￼.
	•	Assessment: No resume value – it’s just a boilerplate (forked likely to start a mobile project or inspect its generators). No unique code by Vaporjawn.

llama.cpp (fork)
	•	Project Summary: A fork of the popular C/C++ implementation of Facebook’s LLaMA AI model ￼.
	•	Assessment: No original content by Vaporjawn. Forked likely out of interest in AI. Not something to claim credit for.

Prime-Number-Finder (Rust)
	•	Project Summary: A Rust program that finds all prime numbers up to a given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes ￼. A beginner-friendly Rust project focusing on algorithm implementation and performance.
	•	Technologies Used: Language: Rust. Likely a simple CLI that reads an input number and outputs primes. Possibly uses cargo for building and running. No external DB or tools; purely computational.
	•	Notable Features: Efficient prime finding via the Sieve algorithm, showcasing use of Rust’s memory safety and performance. Could handle fairly large limits given Rust’s speed. Also an opportunity to manage memory manually (bit vectors for the sieve) which in Rust demonstrates low-level control. The README suggests it’s indeed an educational project to learn Rust programming ￼.
	•	Contributions: Wrote the sieve algorithm in Rust, possibly optimized it (using idiomatic Rust for loops or iterators, avoiding unnecessary allocations). If outputting primes, had to deal with potentially large lists – maybe wrote results to a file or just counted them. This project likely helped Vaporjawn get comfortable with Rust’s syntax and ownership model.
	•	Assessment: Minor resume item. If applying for systems programming roles, mentioning having used Rust could be a plus. But the project itself (prime finder) is a common exercise and not unique. It shows knowledge of algorithms and willingness to learn new languages, which is positive. It could be listed under a Skills section (“learned Rust by implementing efficient algorithms like Sieve of Eratosthenes”) but as a portfolio project it’s not impactful unless expanded significantly.

DotaBot
	•	Project Summary: A utility bot for DOTA2 game data ￼. Possibly a Discord bot or command-line tool that fetches stats or match information via the Dota2 API. The description is very short, so specifics are unclear.
	•	Technologies Used: Language: Python (as indicated) ￼. Likely interacts with Dota 2’s public APIs (such as OpenDota API) to retrieve game statistics, hero data, etc. Could be a simple script or a chatbot using a library like discord.py.
	•	Notable Features: If it’s a Discord bot, it might respond to commands like “!stats playername” and return recent match stats or MMR. If not, it might be a CLI that prints data from a certain Dota2 dataset. Utility could range from match history lookup to hero win-rate calculators. Without a detailed README, one notable aspect is just integrating with a game API and parsing JSON data.
	•	Contributions: Wrote the code to call external API endpoints, parse JSON responses, and format the output for the user. Handled authentication if needed (some Dota APIs require an API key). Possibly implemented scheduling if the bot posts periodic updates (like upcoming esports matches). This project shows ability to work with REST APIs and handle real-world data in Python.
	•	Assessment: Decent small project, but niche. For a resume, this demonstrates API integration and possibly chatbot development, which are good to mention if relevant to the job (for instance, if applying to a role involving bots or gaming). It’s not a large-scale project, so it would be described briefly. Ensure to clarify what the bot does – e.g., “Developed a Python bot that retrieves and displays Dota2 game statistics via the OpenDota API.” That highlights skills in Python and API usage.

(Forked boilerplates like boilerplate-vite-react, react-native-typescript-boilerplate, query, etc.)
	•	Summary: Vaporjawn has several forks of boilerplates (web and mobile) and libraries. These include the Vite+React template, a React Native TS template, and TanStack Query library fork. None of these contain original code by Vaporjawn. They were likely used as starting points or for contributing minor fixes.
	•	Assessment: They don’t merit inclusion on a resume as projects. At most, they show familiarity with these tools, but that can be stated as skills rather than projects.

Pokemon-Showdown-Team-Generator
	•	Project Summary: (Unclear due to missing description) Possibly a tool to generate random Pokémon teams for the Pokémon Showdown battle simulator.
	•	Technologies Used: Could be JavaScript or Python. Updated in Apr 2023, so maybe JavaScript/Node given Vaporjawn’s trends.
	•	Notable Features: If it’s what it sounds like, it might randomly assemble a team of Pokémon (maybe for a particular tier or format) for users who don’t know what to play.
	•	Contributions: Wrote logic to randomly pick Pokémon, moves, etc., conforming to game rules. Could use the Pokémon Showdown data files or API.
	•	Assessment: Without details, hard to evaluate. Likely a small fun project. Not particularly resume-boosting unless applying to something game-related, and even then it’s minor.

Open-Video-Call
	•	Project Summary: “An open source free video call software” ￼. Possibly a WebRTC-based video chat application.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: Could be HTML/JS with WebRTC API. Back-end: Possibly a signaling server (Node with socket.io or WebRTC signaling). It was updated Mar 2023. If functional, it involves real-time media streaming tech.
	•	Notable Features: Likely peer-to-peer video connection in browser, ability to create/join rooms. Could be similar to an open-source Zoom alternative. If completed, that’s quite complex (WebRTC, STUN/TURN servers, etc.). But given no further details and that it’s a generic name, it might have been an experiment not fully realized.
	•	Contributions: Possibly attempted to integrate WebRTC libraries to establish video calls. Could have used a service like PeerJS for simpler signaling.
	•	Assessment: Potentially significant, but unclear. If Vaporjawn managed a working video call app, that’s definitely a big deal (demonstrates networking and real-time media skills). However, without a README or more evidence, it’s uncertain. If not working or incomplete, then it shouldn’t be on the resume. Needs clarification; otherwise skip.

Android-Image-Resizer
	•	Project Summary: A React Native app (Java on Android) to resize local photos on a device ￼. It likely allows a user to pick an image and then creates a resized copy (for easier sharing or uploading).
	•	Technologies Used: Mobile: React Native (the language tagged is Java, which might refer to underlying Android code or simply that React Native involved Java for Android builds). Possibly used an RN library for image processing or wrote native modules.
	•	Notable Features: Select image from gallery, input a desired resolution or percentage, and then save a new image file. Could handle multiple images in batch. It might have a simple UI with an image preview and input fields for dimensions.
	•	Contributions: Built the UI in React Native and implemented the resizing logic. Likely leveraged Android’s bitmap utilities or a library (like Glide or a RN community module) to do the actual image scaling, to avoid writing heavy image processing from scratch. Ensured the new image is saved to storage. This project shows ability to work with device APIs (file system, image handling) and cross-platform RN development (though possibly only tested on Android given the Java tag).
	•	Assessment: Moderately useful to mention. It’s a mobile development example which broadens the portfolio beyond web. If applying for mobile roles or demonstrating versatility, noting a React Native project is good. The functionality (image resize) is straightforward but practical. On a resume: “Developed a React Native app for Android that resizes images locally, handling file I/O and bitmap processing.” That highlights mobile experience and working with native capabilities.

ShortURL
	•	Project Summary: A URL shortener web app ￼. It’s described as comprised of “javascript along with modules and views,” suggesting it’s built with a server-side component (maybe Node.js with an EJS templating for views) and vanilla JS on the client. Possibly created as a small full-stack project.
	•	Technologies Used: Back-end: Node.js + Express, using EJS templates for the HTML. Database: Could be an in-memory store or a JSON file to map short codes to original URLs (since not specified, maybe no persistent DB). Front-end: Simple HTML form for input, and some JavaScript for copy-to-clipboard or AJAX (though might be minimal).
	•	Notable Features: Core feature: generate a short code for a given URL and redirect users who visit the short link. If fully implemented, includes form validation (check URL format), perhaps a hit counter or an expiry feature. Possibly each short URL is alphanumeric. The interesting aspect is the back-end logic to store and retrieve URLs. Since EJS is mentioned, it likely renders the result page or the redirect via server-side.
	•	Contributions: Developed the Express routes: one to accept a new URL and create a shortcode (storing mapping), and one to handle redirect when the shortcode path is visited. Implemented a simple algorithm for generating unique short codes (maybe incremental or hashing). Also created the front-end pages (an input page and a result page that shows the shortened link). This project demonstrates understanding of full-stack basics: handling HTTP requests, dynamic content rendering, and simple persistent storage (if any).
	•	Assessment: Worth mentioning as a classic full-stack example. URL shorteners are common learning projects that cover end-to-end development. If this is fully functional, it’s a neat addition showing Node/Express skills alongside front-end. On a resume, one could say “Built a URL shortener from scratch using Node.js/Express (EJS templating) – implemented URL mapping logic and HTTP redirects.” It’s not unique but it solidifies fundamental web dev skills.

Screen-Recorder
	•	Project Summary: A desktop application for screenshot and screen recording built with ElectronJS ￼. Essentially, a tool to capture the screen (image or video) and save it, possibly with a simple GUI.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: Electron (which uses web tech for UI, likely plain HTML/CSS/JS or a framework within Electron). Back-end: Node.js via Electron main process, possibly using OS-level calls or Node libraries to capture the screen. Libraries: Could use Electron’s desktopCapturer API for screen recording, or an ffmpeg integration for video encoding. Deployment: packaged via Electron.
	•	Notable Features: Allows the user to pick which screen or window to record (if multi-monitor). Can take instantaneous screenshots (saving as PNG) and record videos (saving as MP4 or similar). Likely includes a UI with buttons “Capture Screen” and “Start/Stop Recording.” Notably, implementing continuous screen capture requires handling a lot of data (video frames), possibly with a native addon or an ffmpeg CLI call. The project’s Apache 2.0 license suggests it might incorporate some existing open-source component or was a template. The presence of tags like “electron-app” ￼ indicates it’s fully packaged.
	•	Contributions: Built the Electron app, using Electron’s built-in modules to list displays and capture screens. Managed writing video to file (which is non-trivial; if achieved, that’s impressive). Also created the UI/UX (maybe showing a preview or at least notifications where file is saved). The developer had to handle permissions (screen recording permissions on macOS, for example) and ensure cross-platform compatibility.
	•	Assessment: Strong candidate if functional. This project is quite relevant to system-level application development and shows skill in bridging front-end and OS capabilities. It involves working with multimedia data and possibly integrating with third-party binaries or modules. If Vaporjawn got this to work, it’s definitely a notable project to discuss, as it’s more challenging than standard web apps. It demonstrates problem-solving in a different domain (media capture). For a resume, framing it as “ElectronJS Screen Recorder – developed a cross-platform app to capture screenshots and record desktop video, using Electron’s desktopCapturer and Node stream processing” would catch attention. It indicates ability to deal with performance and native APIs.

React-Coding-Challenge
	•	Project Summary: Likely a repository for a coding challenge solution using React (no description given, updated Mar 1, 2023). Possibly something like a take-home assignment from an interview.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: React + TypeScript. Possibly set up with Vite or CRA. Might involve a specific problem (e.g., a small SPA or a widget).
	•	Notable Features: Unknown without details. Could be anything from a to-do app to a mini-game, depending on the challenge.
	•	Contributions: Implemented whatever the challenge required within React, following any stipulated requirements. Likely demonstrates writing clean React code under time constraints.
	•	Assessment: Neutral. If the challenge problem was interesting or relevant, the project could be explained. Otherwise, by itself the name is generic. It shows the candidate practices or participates in coding exercises, but it’s not necessarily to highlight unless it solves an especially noteworthy problem.

YouTube-to-MP3
	•	Project Summary: An Electron application to convert and download YouTube videos as MP3s ￼. It’s similar to common YouTube downloader tools, with an emphasis on audio extraction. The lightning bolt (⚡️) in the description suggests it’s fast or efficient.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: Electron + possibly a UI framework (could be plain or use something like Bootstrap for layout). Back-end: Likely Node.js within Electron, using libraries like youtube-dl or ytdl-core to fetch video streams, and FFmpeg or similar to extract audio. It might bundle an FFmpeg binary or rely on an API for conversion. Other: The tags show youtube-api, youtube-dl, mp3 ￼, indicating integration with known tools. Possibly uses the YouTube Data API to fetch video info by URL, and youtube-dl for actual downloading.
	•	Notable Features: Allows a user to input a YouTube link and then downloads the audio track as an MP3 file. Likely includes options for output directory. It might multi-thread or queue multiple downloads. The interface probably shows download progress. The use of Electron makes it cross-platform with a GUI, which is user-friendly compared to command-line alternatives.
	•	Contributions: Implemented the integration with YouTube download libraries, handling of video URL parsing, progress feedback in the UI, and MP3 file saving (and tagging maybe). Managed complexities like extracting the highest quality audio stream and converting to MP3 (which involves codec stuff, handled by external tools usually). Also dealt with error cases (invalid URLs, network errors). Essentially built a mini desktop app around existing open-source downloading tools – which is a valuable integration exercise.
	•	Assessment: Good project to mention carefully. Ethically, downloading YouTube content is a gray area (violates YouTube’s ToS), so one might not want to emphasize it strongly. However, from a technical standpoint, it shows skill in using third-party libraries and handling media files, plus building a desktop UI. If included, focus on the technical achievement: “Built a cross-platform Electron app that leverages the YouTube API and FFmpeg to download and convert video audio to MP3, with a real-time progress UI.” This shows ability to integrate multiple systems (web APIs, native encoding libraries) into a cohesive tool.

Spell-Checker
	•	Project Summary: A Python-based operational spell checker that includes a trainer and tests ￼. This likely refers to an implementation of a spell correction algorithm (perhaps Peter Norvig’s spelling correction approach or using a dictionary with edit distance). “Operational” suggests it’s functional and possibly uses a trained model (the word “trainer” hints at probabilistic language model training).
	•	Technologies Used: Language: Python. Possibly uses Python’s standard libraries or re for regex, etc., no heavy ML libraries mentioned (could be plain algorithmic approach). There is an HTML tag in the repo’s info ￼ – perhaps an HTML report or interface was included, or just a misclassified language on GitHub. Testing was likely done (maybe via a separate test script).
	•	Notable Features: Probably can take an input word (potentially misspelled) and suggest the correct spelling. The “trainer” implies it can build a frequency model from a corpus (so it learns which words are common to better guess intended words). Possibly implemented using edit distance (checking all words at Levenshtein distance 1 or 2 from the input, then choosing the most probable). If tests are included, it demonstrates correctness on sample misspellings.
	•	Contributions: Wrote the algorithm for generating candidate corrections (all edits of a word: insertions, deletions, transpositions, replacements), and compiled a dictionary of valid words (maybe from a large corpus or dictionary file). Implemented a simple probability model (word frequencies) to rank candidates. Also created a framework to test it (feeding known misspellings and checking if output matches expected correction). This is classic NLP 101 work – implementing a known solution from scratch.
	•	Assessment: Good algorithmic project. It showcases Python skills and understanding of algorithms and basic machine learning (language modeling). If the job role involves algorithms or NLP, this is a strong talking point. Otherwise, it still reflects problem-solving and ability to implement non-trivial logic. It can be listed as “Implemented a spell-checker in Python from scratch, including a probabilistic model trained on English text and an edit-distance algorithm for candidate generation.” That communicates both coding and analytical skills.

Node-REST-API
	•	Project Summary: A RESTful API example built in Node.js, created for a talk or presentation ￼. This suggests Vaporjawn gave a talk on building a REST API and this repository contains the example code (maybe a simple CRUD API, e.g., for a to-do list or student records).
	•	Technologies Used: Back-end: Node.js with Express (likely, given the context). Data store: possibly just in-memory or a JSON file, or a simple use of an array (for demo purposes). Could also integrate a database if it was part of the demo (but tags show json, routes, implying maybe just JSON storage or sample data).
	•	Notable Features: Implements the standard REST operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on some resource. Might include multiple routes and demonstrate best practices (using middleware, proper status codes, maybe JWT auth if it was a security talk). Since it was for a talk, the code might be clean and didactic, rather than full-featured production ready.
	•	Contributions: Wrote all the route handlers, demonstrating how to structure an Express app (router modules, app.js, etc.). Possibly showed how to parse JSON request bodies, how to handle errors, and how to format JSON responses. If it was interactive during the talk, maybe included an API documentation or example client calls. Essentially, it’s an educational piece of code.
	•	Assessment: Worth mentioning if relevant to back-end roles. It’s not a unique product, but it underscores experience with Node/Express. One could note: “Created a demo RESTful API in Node/Express, showcasing REST principles (for a technical presentation).” That quietly signals public speaking/knowledge sharing experience too, which is a nice bonus. As a project alone, it’s simple, but in context it highlights communication and teaching ability as well.

(Forks: query, project-clippi, OpenEmu, b0xx-ahk, rpcs3, dolphin)
	•	Summary: These are all forks of either libraries or large projects (TanStack Query, a Smash Bros Melee automation, emulator projects, etc.). Vaporjawn did not author these; presumably forked to explore or contribute.
	•	Assessment: These should not be listed as personal projects. They indicate interests (for example, interest in emulators and gaming), but unless Vaporjawn contributed code to them, they aren’t his projects. They can be omitted in favor of discussing actual contributions.

RGB-Calculator
	•	Project Summary: A web UI to calculate and display an RGB color combination ￼. Possibly the user moves sliders for R, G, B values and the app shows the resulting color and the numeric code.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Might be pure JS or using jQuery given it’s a 2023 or earlier small project. There’s a mention of UI (shows resulting color), likely built with basic web tech (maybe an <input type="range"> for sliders).
	•	Notable Features: Simple interactive color picker, where combining the three values updates a swatch of color in real-time. Also possibly displays the hex code or RGBA value.
	•	Contributions: Coded the interactive behavior (event listeners on sliders to update the display div’s background color). Provided a clean UI for users to experiment with RGB values. It may also have presets or the ability to copy the color code. This is a straightforward DOM manipulation exercise.
	•	Assessment: Minor project. It’s essentially a learning exercise in DOM and event handling. On a resume, it’s too trivial to highlight, given it’s akin to tasks done in an introductory web dev course.

Lyfe (Conway’s Game of Life in Ruby)
	•	Project Summary: A recreation of Conway’s Game of Life in Ruby ￼. Possibly a command-line program or simple terminal visualization of the cellular automaton.
	•	Technologies Used: Language: Ruby (with Gherkin listed, which is odd – perhaps tests were written in Cucumber/Gherkin style?). Possibly a TDD approach with scenarios described in Gherkin. The game logic is Ruby.
	•	Notable Features: Implements the classic Life rules on a grid. Likely prints successive generations of cells. The interesting part is the use of Gherkin, indicating behavior-driven development tests (maybe scenarios like “Given an initial configuration, after one tick, these cells should be alive”). That shows knowledge of BDD frameworks.
	•	Contributions: Wrote the algorithm to compute the next generation of the grid from the current generation (applying the 4 rules of Life). If a GUI or ASCII output, also handled displaying it. Set up Cucumber tests to verify patterns (like a blinker oscillates every generation, or a block remains stable). This indicates a thorough approach to even a toy problem.
	•	Assessment: Educational project. It demonstrates ability to learn a new language (Ruby) and apply testing practices. If applying to a company that uses Ruby (for web or tooling), it’s worth a small mention that the candidate has Ruby exposure. Otherwise, it’s not a large-scale project – just a nice example of algorithm implementation and testing.

react-native-bottom-sheet (fork)
	•	Summary: A fork of a UI library for bottom sheets in React Native. No original content by Vaporjawn.
	•	Assessment: Omit.

Trivia-Game (Web)
	•	Project Summary: A trivia quiz game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ￼. Likely a simple web quiz: maybe multiple-choice questions and you get a score at the end.
	•	Technologies Used: Vanilla JS for game logic, HTML/CSS for layout. Possibly JSON for questions.
	•	Notable Features: Possibly a timer, scoring, and dynamic question progression. Might have a fixed set of questions or pull from an API.
	•	Contributions: Implemented front-end logic for cycling through questions, checking answers, and showing results. Maybe stored high scores in LocalStorage.
	•	Assessment: Basic project. Shows ability to create an interactive webpage. Fine as a learning step, but on a resume it’s very common and not distinctive, unless it had something special like asynchronous question fetching or a novel twist.

Save-As-Discord-Plugin
	•	Project Summary: A Discord plugin (BetterDiscord) that lets you right-click and save media directly to your computer ￼. Essentially, this adds a context menu item “Save As…” for images/videos in Discord, which by default don’t have a direct save option.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: JavaScript, running in Discord’s client context via BetterDiscord. It hooks into Discord’s interface and file download functions.
	•	Notable Features: It intercepts media URLs and triggers a save dialog when the user chooses the context menu option. This is a quality-of-life mod for Discord.
	•	Contributions: Wrote the plugin script, which likely involves injecting into Discord’s UI event handlers. The developer needed to identify Discord’s DOM structure or internal functions that handle context menus, then extend them. They also had to ensure the file is saved with the correct name/extension, using Node’s fs (BetterDiscord plugins have access to Node API) or a browser API if in that context.
	•	Assessment: Interesting hack, but not for formal resume. It shows ingenuity in customizing applications, and solid JS skills. However, BetterDiscord mods are unofficial. As a talking point, it’s cool (if the interviewer is into Discord), but professionally it’s not a supported development environment. It can be briefly mentioned under personal projects, but carefully.

tictactoe (Web)
	•	Project Summary: A web version of Tic Tac Toe ￼. Likely a 3x3 grid game playable against a simple AI or two-player locally.
	•	Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Possibly jQuery or vanilla DOM.
	•	Notable Features: Standard tic-tac-toe rules. If an AI is implemented, it might be a simple heuristic or minimax algorithm (but given the archive nature, perhaps it’s just two-player or a very basic AI).
	•	Contributions: Built the interface (grid of buttons or divs) and game logic to check wins, draws, and switch turns. If AI included, implemented logic to choose an available cell (maybe random or a trivial strategy).
	•	Assessment: Very basic. Commonly done as an early project in learning front-end. Unless the AI was sophisticated (which is unlikely here), it doesn’t stand out.

Discord-Moosik
	•	Project Summary: A Discord music bot that plays music in voice channels ￼. Users in Discord servers could use commands to play songs from YouTube or playlists.
	•	Technologies Used: Back-end: Node.js with Discord.js library. Audio streaming: youtube-dl or ytdl-core to get audio streams, ffmpeg to stream to Discord voice. Data: Possibly no database, ephemeral queues held in memory.
	•	Notable Features: Likely supports commands like !play [song name or URL], !skip, !stop, making use of the Discord bot APIs. It queues songs and streams audio in real time. This requires handling asynchronous events and maintaining a queue of requests. It’s essentially a simplified version of popular open-source music bots.
	•	Contributions: Developed the bot logic: connecting to voice channels, managing an audio queue, interfacing with YouTube API or search to find the requested track, and controlling playback with ffmpeg. Also handled command parsing and error messaging (e.g., if no song found, if bot not in channel, etc.). It’s a fairly involved project given real-time audio and integration with third-party services.
	•	Assessment: Resume-relevant if focusing on bots or real-time apps. Among personal projects, a fully functional music bot demonstrates a combination of API usage, concurrency (handling multiple user commands), and possibly some systems knowledge (audio streaming). It is similar in scope to the YouTube-to-MP3 project but operates live in Discord. If applying to companies dealing with streaming or chat apps, this could be highlighted. Otherwise, mention it to show Node.js proficiency and interest in music/communication tech: “Built a Discord music bot in Node.js that streams YouTube audio to voice channels, including command handling and playlist queue management.”

Emulators-Bios
	•	Project Summary: A collection of BIOS files for various emulators ￼. No code; just binary BIOS ROMs. Possibly hosted for convenience.
	•	Assessment: Not a software project. (Also of questionable legality to distribute BIOS files). Definitely exclude from resume.

Dalle-Images
	•	Project Summary: A repository of images encountered through DALL·E (an AI image generator) ￼. Probably just outputs or experiments, no code.
	•	Assessment: Not relevant to development skills. It’s an art/AI curiosity repository.

L-Bozo
	•	Project Summary: Unclear (no description besides “L-Bozo”). Possibly a joke or meme repository, updated mid-2022. Without info, likely not significant.
	•	Assessment: Skip.

antimicro (fork)
	•	Project Summary: Fork of AntiMicro (a gamepad-to-keyboard mapping tool) ￼. No original development by Vaporjawn.
	•	Assessment: Omit.

Traveling-Salesman-Problem
	•	Project Summary: Likely a project tackling the Traveling Salesman Problem using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) approach ￼. This implies a heuristic AI solution to TSP. Perhaps a Python implementation (tag shows Python, MIT License) ￼. It might visualize a set of cities and the SOM gradually improving a tour.
	•	Technologies Used: Python (possibly with libraries like numpy for the SOM algorithm). Maybe matplotlib for visualization.
	•	Notable Features: Uses a neural network (SOM) to approximate a solution to TSP, which is a clever approach. If completed, it can show the path improving over iterations. This is more of a computational experiment than a user-facing app.
	•	Contributions: Implemented the SOM algorithm (a type of unsupervised learning) and applied it to TSP. This involves coding the neuron network that “maps” to city coordinates and updating weights iteratively. It demonstrates knowledge of neural networks and optimization problems.
	•	Assessment: Strong for algorithmic/AI interest. Even if it’s a school or personal experiment, it shows tackling an NP-hard problem with an innovative method. For resumes oriented to data science or algorithm development, this is a good project to mention (“Explored solving the Traveling Salesman Problem via Self-Organizing Maps in Python”). It indicates familiarity with AI concepts beyond standard web dev.

YouTube_Not_Interested_Button (fork)
	•	Summary: A fork of a Chrome extension that hides YouTube “Not Interested” feedback button (just guessing from name). Not Vaporjawn’s own project.
	•	Assessment: Not applicable.

FizzBuzz
	•	Project Summary: A straightforward FizzBuzz implementation in Java ￼. Possibly an exercise from early learning or a coding challenge repo.
	•	Technologies Used: Java console program likely.
	•	Notable Features: None (FizzBuzz just prints numbers or “Fizz”/“Buzz”).
	•	Assessment: Too trivial. Not to be included except to indicate familiarity with a language (but better projects do that anyway).

BetterDiscordPlugins (fork from Metalloriff)
	•	Summary: Another BetterDiscord plugins repository forked in 2021 ￼. Vaporjawn’s own plugin work is separate; this is just a fork of someone else’s.
	•	Assessment: Not original.

Graphing-Calculator
	•	Project Summary: A graphing calculator made in JavaScript ￼. It provides a UI to input mathematical functions and plots their graphs on a coordinate plane.
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: HTML5 Canvas or SVG for drawing graphs, vanilla JS for parsing equations and plotting points. Possibly uses math libraries for parsing (or wrote a simple parser).
	•	Notable Features: Allows multiple functions to be graphed, zooming or panning possibly. Might support basic expressions like polynomials, trig, etc. The UI might have an input field and a canvas where the graph appears. Handling scaling and axes drawing is notable.
	•	Contributions: Built a math expression parser or integrated one to interpret user input, computed (x, y) pairs for the function across a range, and rendered the curve on a Canvas context. Also drew axes and tick marks. This is an ambitious front-end project requiring both math and graphics, and the repository shows an open issue “needs help” which implies it was a work in progress or inviting contributions ￼.
	•	Assessment: Good to show front-end and math skills. If it’s functional, this project is visually impressive and conceptually cool. It demonstrates capability in algorithm (parsing & plotting) and in HTML Canvas manipulation. On a resume, it can be listed as “Graphing Calculator in JavaScript – built an interactive plotter for user-defined functions using HTML Canvas.” That signals proficiency in both computational logic and front-end drawing.

KickUp-Coding-Challenge
	•	Project Summary: Probably code for a specific coding challenge (perhaps from a platform or interview). The name “KickUp” might refer to a company or platform’s challenge. No details on functionality (likely solved a given algorithmic problem).
	•	Technologies Used: JavaScript (tagged as such, updated 2021) ￼. Possibly just one or a few JS files solving something.
	•	Assessment: Not enough context. If the challenge was something notable and the solution was elegant, it could be discussed in an interview, but as a project entry it’s too vague.

ektajpu (fork)
	•	Summary: Fork of an Esperanto transliteration tool (x-system to proper characters) ￼. Not Vaporjawn’s original work.
	•	Assessment: Omit.

akaneia-build (fork)
	•	Summary: Fork of a Smash Bros Melee mod/build ￼. No original content by Vaporjawn.
	•	Assessment: Omit.

The-Lombardi-Project
	•	Project Summary: No description other than name and date (late 2020). Possibly something sports-related (Vince Lombardi? or a play on a meme). Without info, can’t tell. Could have been a school group project. Updated Dec 2020 but has no detail to highlight.
	•	Assessment: Unknown, likely skip. If it was important, Vaporjawn would have described it.

Pokemon-Showdown-Teams
	•	Project Summary: A compilation of Pokémon Showdown teams for people who “don’t know what to make” ￼. Essentially a data repository of pre-made competitive teams.
	•	Technologies Used: JSON or plain text (Showdown’s team export format) for each team. Possibly a simple web interface listing them, but likely just files.
	•	Notable Features: It’s a template repo (Unlicense) suggesting it’s meant for sharing teams publicly.
	•	Contributions: Collected and organized various competitive Pokémon team configurations. No actual code beyond maybe a script to format them.
	•	Assessment: Not a coding project. It’s gaming knowledge being shared. Not relevant to software skills directly.

Esperanta-Klavaro
	•	Project Summary: An Esperanto keyboard for iOS ￼. This sounds like an iOS app (perhaps an iPhone custom keyboard extension) that allows typing Esperanto characters easily.
	•	Technologies Used: Language: Swift (as indicated) ￼. It likely is an iOS Keyboard Extension which is a specific type of app extension. This involves building a custom keyboard UI with keys for special letters (like ĉ, ĝ, ĵ, etc.).
	•	Notable Features: Provides the full Esperanto alphabet input method on iOS, which doesn’t support Esperanto out-of-the-box. Possibly includes a toggle between QWERTY and Esperanto mode, predictive text might not be included (complex to implement). It being archived suggests it was at least functional but not maintained.
	•	Contributions: Created the keyboard layout in Interface Builder or programmatically, handled input proxy to insert characters into the text field, and dealt with iOS keyboard constraints (like enabling full access if needed). This demonstrates mobile development skills, particularly iOS extension development which can be intricate.
	•	Assessment: Niche but technical. If applying to mobile dev positions, this is a nice example of solving a real user need with a custom iOS feature. It’s also a unique project showing linguistic interest. On a resume, one might phrase it as “Developed a custom iOS keyboard in Swift to support the Esperanto alphabet.” This shows experience with Swift and iOS frameworks outside of just standard apps.

Devils-Love-Sticker-Pack
	•	Project Summary: Another sticker pack, this time for a web comic by @Zizai_orangebrush ￼. Similar nature to Bee-and-Puppycat pack but for a specific comic.
	•	Technologies Used: Image files. Possibly arranged as a Telegram or Signal sticker pack.
	•	Contributions: Collected or created stickers from the webcomic artwork.
	•	Assessment: Not code-related. Skip for resume.

React-Tac-Toe
	•	Project Summary: Tic Tac Toe implemented in React ￼. This is the React tutorial classic example or a small project practicing state and props.
	•	Technologies Used: React (JavaScript).
	•	Notable Features: Likely supports a basic 2-player game and maybe records move history (as seen in the official React tutorial).
	•	Contributions: Followed best practices in React (lifting state up, immutability for time-travel debugging if did the official tutorial).
	•	Assessment: Basic. Good as a learning milestone in React, but too elementary to highlight when more complex React projects (Background-Sounds, Orderbook, etc.) exist.

GameBoy-Snake-Game
	•	Project Summary: The classic Snake game with a GameBoy-style overlay for the browser ￼. Likely a canvas-based snake game with a GameBoy frame drawn around it for nostalgia.
	•	Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Canvas for game). Possibly used an image of a GameBoy as a border.
	•	Notable Features: Snake gameplay (moving dot eating food, growing, game over on collision). The GameBoy theme is a fun UI twist.
	•	Contributions: Coded the game loop (using setInterval or requestAnimationFrame), handled input (arrow keys), collision detection, and scoring. Added the cosmetic frame to mimic playing on a GameBoy.
	•	Assessment: Classic beginner project. It shows comfort with canvas and game logic, which is positive, but it’s overshadowed by more advanced projects. Could be mentioned as a fun fact if discussing interest in game development.

melee (fork)
	•	Summary: Fork of a Smash Bros Melee decompilation project. No personal code.
	•	Assessment: Not relevant to resume (unless contributions were made, which is unlikely in a fork).

NotAnotherAnimeTheme (fork)
	•	Summary: Fork of a Discord theme (probably). No unique content.
	•	Assessment: Omit.

Temple-University-Computer-Science-Resources
	•	Project Summary: A repository containing files related to Temple University’s CS curriculum ￼. Possibly homework, labs, exams solutions, etc., aggregated (maybe by Vaporjawn for personal study or to help others).
	•	Technologies Used: Various (since it likely includes C, Java, etc., files from different courses). But it’s not a cohesive project, more a directory of school work.
	•	Notable Features: It’s basically an archive of academic materials. If made public, it was to share or preserve them.
	•	Contributions: Collected and uploaded course materials or personal notes/solutions. It indicates breadth of knowledge (since tags include multiple languages). But it’s not an application.
	•	Assessment: Not a project to list. It’s more of a repository of notes. On a resume, one would instead explicitly list relevant coursework or knowledge rather than point to this repository.

Javascript-Calculator
	•	Project Summary: A calculator made with JavaScript and ES6 ￼. Likely a web-based basic calculator (with a UI for digits and operations).
	•	Technologies Used: HTML/CSS for layout (maybe a grid of buttons), vanilla JS (ES6) for the calculation logic. Possibly uses eval or implements its own expression parser for operations order.
	•	Notable Features: Standard four-function calculator functionality, maybe with keyboard support. Possibly handles floating point and clears, etc.
	•	Contributions: Built the interactive UI, managed state for current input and stored value, and implemented the logic for operations and updating the display. Ensured continuous operations (chaining calculations) work correctly.
	•	Assessment: Fundamental project. Good for learning but too simple to draw attention to on a resume, especially compared to more complex items on this list.

Hangman
	•	Project Summary: The classic Hangman game made in Java ￼. Likely a console application or possibly a simple Swing GUI where a user guesses letters and the program reveals letters or draws hangman stages in text.
	•	Technologies Used: Java (maybe just core libraries, Scanner for input if console). Possibly used an ASCII art or simple text to show progress.
	•	Notable Features: Reads input letter by letter, checks against a secret word, tracks wrong guesses, and ends game with win/lose. Possibly random word selection from a small list.
	•	Contributions: Implemented game loop, letter checking, and state tracking (letters guessed, remaining tries). If any UI beyond console, that would be an extra complexity (though none mentioned, likely console-based given context).
	•	Assessment: Basic programming exercise. Not distinctive enough for a resume given the other projects available.

Janken (Rock-Paper-Scissors)
	•	Project Summary: A Rock-Paper-Scissors simulator ￼, called “Janken” (Japanese term for RPS). Possibly text-based or a simple GUI.
	•	Technologies Used: JavaScript (since extension is “–Rock-Paper-Scissors” which looks like a web name, but it might actually be Java or another language – not clear). Possibly a small web or Java app.
	•	Notable Features: Likely just plays RPS against a random choice or allows two-player on same machine. Might count scores if repeated.
	•	Assessment: Trivial. Not something to highlight except as part of a list of smaller completed exercises.

AutoHD-for-YouTube (Chrome Extension)
	•	Project Summary: A Chrome extension to automatically select the best HD quality on YouTube or a user’s preferred quality ￼. This removes the need to manually adjust video quality each time.
	•	Technologies Used: Browser extension tech: JavaScript (content script), maybe some JSON config (manifest v2 in 2020). It monitors YouTube’s player element via the DOM or YouTube’s player API.
	•	Notable Features: On opening a YouTube video, the extension will detect the available qualities and switch to the highest or user-specified (e.g., always 1080p) if not already. Possibly provides an options menu to set the preferred resolution. Must handle dynamic content (YouTube is SPA – so might use MutationObserver to catch when a new video loads).
	•	Contributions: Developed the content script logic to interact with YouTube’s player. This could involve simulating clicks on the quality menu or using the HTML5 video API if accessible. Also wrote the manifest and any background script needed. Dealt with timing issues (ensuring the video element exists before trying to change quality).
	•	Assessment: Solid extension project. It solves a real annoyance. On a resume, it shows ability to work with browser APIs and manipulate third-party web apps. It is a bit hacky by nature (reverse-engineering YouTube’s interface), but widely useful. If polished (maybe published on Chrome Web Store with users), that can be mentioned. It demonstrates front-end scripting skills. It’s a smaller codebase but a practical one. It could be included as “Created a Chrome extension to force YouTube videos to play in HD by default, utilizing DOM scripting and YouTube’s player controls.” Good for front-end/tooling roles.

Number-Guessing-Bot
	•	Project Summary: A chatbot that you can play a number guessing game with ￼. Possibly a simple interactive bot in a messaging platform or console, where the bot chooses a number and you guess with hints given.
	•	Technologies Used: Possibly built on a bot framework (could be Discord, Slack, or just a terminal prompt). The tags show HTML and bot-related keywords ￼, which is odd (HTML for a bot?). Could be a web chatbot or an IRC bot.
	•	Notable Features: The bot engages in a conversation: e.g., “I’m thinking of a number 1-100, try to guess,” then responds “higher” or “lower” until guessed. If it was on a platform like Facebook Messenger or Discord, integrating with those APIs is notable. Otherwise, it’s a straightforward logic.
	•	Contributions: Implemented random number generation and a loop to process user input and respond accordingly. If on a chat platform, handled incoming messages and maintained game state per user.
	•	Assessment: Minor. It’s an interactive toy. If it involved integration with a chat API, that aspect is somewhat interesting (similar to other bots). If it’s just console, it’s trivial. Not a standout compared to other listed projects.

Bouncing-DVD-Algorithm (p5.js)
	•	Project Summary: A simulation of the bouncing DVD logo screensaver ￼. This likely shows the DVD logo moving and bouncing off edges of the screen, changing color perhaps when it hits a corner (a nostalgic computer meme).
	•	Technologies Used: JavaScript with p5.js or plain canvas for animation. The tags mention p5 and algorithm ￼. So likely built with the p5.js library which simplifies drawing and animation.
	•	Notable Features: Recreates a known screensaver accurately – DVD logo hitting corners. Possibly tracks how many times it hits a corner. The main algorithm is just inverting velocity when edges are hit (so very simple physics).
	•	Contributions: Wrote the drawing loop and edge-collision logic. Possibly added extras like random color change on bounce. This is a fun visual project but straightforward mathematically.
	•	Assessment: Fun but not impressive to employers by itself. It shows the ability to animate with p5.js, which is cool, but it’s a small script. It could be portfolio filler for front-end/creative coding roles, but given bigger projects, it’s not necessary to list this on a resume unless one has space and wants to demonstrate passion for simple visual programs.

Black-Hole-Visualization (p5.js)
	•	Project Summary: A visualization of how light (photons) travels around a black hole, likely demonstrating gravitational lensing or orbits ￼. This is a more advanced physics simulation or rendering. It might depict the bending of light paths near a black hole’s gravity well. Possibly an adaptation of known general relativity demos for a 2D canvas.
	•	Technologies Used: JavaScript with p5.js (tagged). Could involve some math for the spacetime curvature effect.
	•	Notable Features: If accurately done, it’s visually striking – showing distortion of background star field around a central black circle (the black hole). The algorithm might implement a simple model of gravitational lensing in 2D. Could allow user interaction (changing parameters like black hole mass or photon trajectories).
	•	Contributions: Implemented the physics/geometry to simulate or approximate light bending. Drew the results in an animation or static image. Possibly included controls to adjust the scenario. This indicates the ability to apply physics formulas in code and create educational visuals.
	•	Assessment: Potentially impressive for creative/technical roles. It’s not an everyday app – it’s a visualization project that combines programming with scientific concepts. If Vaporjawn understood and coded the math, it’s a great talking point about learning beyond typical dev tasks. For a resume, it’s niche but could highlight breadth of interests and ability to do algorithm-heavy visuals. For example, “Created a p5.js visualization of light paths bending around a black hole, applying principles of gravitational lensing in a graphical simulation.” That’s unique and memorable, if space allows for an extra project.

Bubble-Sort-Visualization (p5.js)
	•	Project Summary: A visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm made in Python (though tagged JS, likely it’s p5 again or maybe Processing.py) ￼. Shows the process of bubble sort on an array of values as a graphic – typically bars that get swapped step by step with maybe highlights.
	•	Technologies Used: Possibly Python (if Processing’s Python mode or just mis-tagged; but given context, maybe it was p5.js as well – tags show both Python and p5). Let’s assume JavaScript with p5 for consistency.
	•	Notable Features: Animates the sorting of a list: each pair comparison and swap can be visualized. It’s a common algorithm visualization for teaching.
	•	Contributions: Implemented bubble sort in a visual manner – this requires slowing down the algorithm to display each swap, using setTimeout or frame-by-frame stepping. Provided a clear representation of the array (bars or dots). Possibly added controls to start/pause or adjust speed.
	•	Assessment: Educational small project. It demonstrates understanding of the algorithm and basic animation control. Similar to other small visualizations, it’s nice for a portfolio site section but not a highlight for resume, except to show interest in teaching/communication of algorithms. Given more substantial work, this would be low priority to mention.

Tic-Tac-Toe (HTML/CSS/JS)
	•	Project Summary: Already covered React version; this entry might be an earlier HTML/CSS/JS TicTacToe (since it’s listed separately as “Tic-Tac-Toe” in early 2020, perhaps before the React remake).
	•	Assessment: Duplicate concept; not needed on resume.

Fast-Food-Demo (C#)
	•	Project Summary: A mock fast-food menu solution made in C# ￼. Perhaps a simple UI or console app representing ordering process or menu management. It could have been a class assignment (design a system for ordering and seat allocation, given context of “fast food”).
	•	Technologies Used: C# – possibly WinForms or WPF if it had a GUI; or a console if simpler. Possibly accompanied by a UML design if it was an OOP exercise.
	•	Notable Features: If GUI, displays a menu of items, allows selection and calculates total, etc. If it’s more system-focused, maybe it was about using inheritance/polymorphism (food items as objects).
	•	Contributions: Wrote the classes for menu items, maybe classes for orders, and logic to simulate the ordering. Could include a basic database or list to store orders. Without more detail, likely a small scale demonstration of C# capabilities.
	•	Assessment: Low impact. Unless it had a novel approach or complexity (which the term “mock solution” suggests it didn’t), it’s not worth highlighting among bigger projects. It shows knowledge of C#, but Esperanta-Klavaro (if in Swift) and others show knowledge of multiple languages as well.

websites (HTML/CSS templates)
	•	Project Summary: A collection of simple websites coded by Vaporjawn, perhaps examples or experiments in web design ￼. Possibly static template sites (like a personal blog prototype, a fake business homepage, etc.).
	•	Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, maybe minimal JS.
	•	Notable Features: They might illustrate different layouts or CSS tricks. Possibly just practice in responsive design or theming.
	•	Assessment: Not a single cohesive project. They show practice in web design but would not be listed individually on a resume. The best bits (if any design was excellent) could be part of a portfolio site rather than text on resume.

Copy-Video-at-Time-for-Twitch-FireFox
	•	Project Summary: A userscript or extension for Firefox that adds a feature on Twitch: “Copy video at [current] time” (akin to YouTube’s copy video URL at current time) ￼. This implies when watching Twitch VODs, the script can copy the URL with a timestamp.
	•	Technologies Used: JavaScript (as a Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey userscript or a browser extension). It interacts with Twitch’s video player DOM or URL parameters.
	•	Notable Features: Provides a convenience functionality Twitch doesn’t have by default. Listens for a user action (maybe a context menu or a button in UI) and computes the current playback time, then constructs a URL with that time (Twitch VODs use a t= parameter or similar for timestamps) ￼. Possibly displays a confirmation or directly copies to clipboard via the Clipboard API.
	•	Contributions: Wrote the script to hook into Twitch’s player, get the video time (likely via the video element’s currentTime property or a Twitch player API if available), and register a menu command (Greasemonkey allows adding custom menu items). Ensured it works consistently as Twitch is a dynamic site.
	•	Assessment: Useful hack, minor project. It demonstrates ability to write custom browser scripts and understanding of video web apps. Like other browser mods, it’s neat but not major. It can be referenced to show ability to improve UX with small scripts (good for front-end initiative), but not necessary if space is tight.

C-Sharp-Calculator
	•	Project Summary: A calculator in C# ￼ – likely a Windows Forms app mimicking a basic calculator UI.
	•	Technologies Used: C# with WinForms (most straightforward for a quick GUI in C#). Buttons for digits and operations, label for display.
	•	Notable Features: Basic arithmetic operations, likely no advanced features (maybe ± and clear). It’s the C# equivalent of the JS calculator done elsewhere.
	•	Contributions: Built the form layout, wrote event handlers for button clicks, and managed the calculation logic (accumulating operand, applying operation on next input, etc.). Possibly learned about DataBindings or simple MVC in the process.
	•	Assessment: Fundamental practice. Not to list on resume given other more interesting items, unless highlighting multi-language proficiency (and even then, better to mention something like the Android image resizer for C# usage if that was WPF, but that was React Native in Java, so this is the only C# UI aside from Fast-Food-Demo). If needed, just note familiarity with C# and WinForms rather than listing the project name.

Maze.JS
	•	Project Summary: A maze generator in JavaScript ￼. Possibly creates a random maze using an algorithm (like depth-first search or Kruskal’s) and could also include a solver.
	•	Technologies Used: JavaScript for logic, and maybe HTML Canvas or table to display the maze. Could be an algorithmic visualization or just generate text maze. The tags show multiple “maze” related tags ￼, indicating focus on generation algorithms.
	•	Notable Features: If it truly generates random mazes, it likely uses a known algorithm (recursive backtracker, etc.), which is a solid algorithmic accomplishment. Might display the generation step by step or just instantly output the final maze. Possibly playable or solvable by a user, but not stated.
	•	Contributions: Implemented the maze generation algorithm efficiently. If visual, coded the drawing of the maze. Possibly provided different maze sizes. This shows knowledge of graph algorithms and randomization.
	•	Assessment: Good algorithm practice, small scale. Similar to the TSP or Life projects, it indicates interest in algorithms. If there’s space, one could mention “Implemented a random maze generator in JS (using DFS algorithm) with a visual output.” It’s a decent minor achievement. Not crucial if resume already has many items, but it’s not completely trivial either, since many devs might not have done maze generation.

CIS-3515 (Mobile Apps Lab repository)
	•	Project Summary: Collection of all labs from a Mobile Applications course (Temple’s CIS 3515) ￼. Likely Android apps (since mobile dev, maybe some are Java/Android and some hybrid).
	•	Assessment: Not an individual project but coursework collection. Not for resume.

Slot-Machine (C#)
	•	Project Summary: A slot machine game made in C# ￼. Possibly a WinForms app with reels that spin (either text-based or with images).
	•	Technologies Used: C# WinForms/WPF. Uses random number generator to simulate slot reels and outputs results.
	•	Notable Features: Basic gambling simulation. Could have simple graphics (maybe three PictureBoxes cycling through images).
	•	Contributions: Programmed the random outcome logic, a method to “spin” (likely by quickly changing images then stopping), and win calculation.
	•	Assessment: Simple GUI project. It’s fine but not distinctive. Similar to the calculator in showing Windows GUI coding.

Programing-and-Abstraction (Java class repository)
	•	Summary: Possibly code from a Programming Abstractions course (maybe data structures and OOP assignments, mention of “morris, temple-university, karl” suggests specific professor or textbook content) ￼.
	•	Assessment: Course assignments, not a coherent project to list.

GOP-Candidates (Web data project)
	•	Project Summary: Unclear, but given tags (JavaScript, small number of stars/forks) ￼, might be a simple site that listed GOP candidates (for 2020 election) with some info or interactive feature. Possibly just a static page with bios or a comparison chart.
	•	Assessment: Not enough info to include. It might have been a quick project during election season; without known functionality, skip.

Feel-The-Bern (Chrome Extension)
	•	Project Summary: A Chrome extension, likely Bernie Sanders themed (maybe replacing words or adding Bernie images) ￼. Could hide negative mentions or something political. The tags mention chrome-extension, chromedriver, sanders ￼, so it might automate something in Chrome related to Bernie. Possibly part of a hackathon.
	•	Assessment: Not clear or generally useful for resume. Unless the extension had a technical nuance, it’s likely a novelty.

Sud0ku
	•	Project Summary: A Sudoku game and solver in Python (and a JS version) ￼. The name with zero (Sud0ku) is playful. It includes a GUI (maybe Qt or Pygame for Python, or a web UI for JS version) or at least solves puzzles with algorithm. Possibly both a playable game and an auto-solver.
	•	Technologies Used: Python for solver algorithm (backtracking) and maybe a simple console or Tkinter UI. Also mentions a JavaScript version, which could be an HTML/JS UI.
	•	Notable Features: If a solver, it employs backtracking search to fill the grid – a classic algorithm problem. If a game, it generates puzzles and allows user input and checks validity. Having two versions shows multi-language implementation.
	•	Contributions: Coded the algorithm to solve Sudoku efficiently. Provided an interface for input (maybe reading puzzle from a file or a basic GUI). Possibly implemented puzzle generation (which is more complex, likely not, as that’s advanced). The fact it’s in both Python and JS might mean Vaporjawn translated it to JS for a web version.
	•	Assessment: Good algorithmic project. A Sudoku solver is a notable accomplishment for algorithm practice. It demonstrates recursion/backtracking, and if a GUI, event handling and constraint checking in real-time. For a resume, this shows problem-solving and cross-language ability. Mention if space permits: “Built a Sudoku solver in Python (with a GUI) and a web-based Sudoku game/solver in JavaScript.”

Word-Generator
	•	Project Summary: A webpage to generate a random word ￼. Possibly just picks a random word from a dictionary on each refresh or button click. Could be for creative writing or vocabulary.
	•	Technologies Used: JavaScript with a word list (maybe an array of words in JS or an API call to a random word API).
	•	Notable Features: Very minimal – click a button, get a word. Possibly includes options (word length, category).
	•	Assessment: Too trivial. Not much to discuss – skip.

Retro-Catch-the-Block
	•	Project Summary: A retro-style “Catch the Block” game ￼. Likely a clone of a simple game where blocks fall and you move a paddle to catch them, with retro (8-bit) styling. Possibly made with HTML/JS or a retro game library.
	•	Technologies Used: Likely HTML5 Canvas or just DOM for graphics, JavaScript for game logic. Retro styling maybe via pixel art.
	•	Contributions: Implemented falling objects, collision detection with paddle, score keeping. Possibly used CSS for CRT effect or similar.
	•	Assessment: Small game project. Fun to make, but as with other small games, on a resume only mention if emphasizing game development interest. Otherwise, it’s one of many such small web games out there.

Typing-Speed-Calculator
	•	Project Summary: A webapp that calculates typing WPM (words per minute) ￼. Likely presents a text to type and measures how fast and accurately the user types it.
	•	Technologies Used: HTML/CSS for layout (maybe a textarea or input field), JavaScript for timing and calculating WPM and maybe error rate. Possibly uses Date timing and simple string comparisons.
	•	Notable Features: Measures real-time typing speed, could highlight errors or just output final stats. Might use a timer and on each key press count characters.
	•	Contributions: Wrote the logic to start a timer when user begins typing, count characters and divide by time to get CPM/WPM, and display results. Possibly included preset texts or user can paste their own.
	•	Assessment: Basic utility. It demonstrates working with keyboard events and timing in JS, which is fine, but not distinctive for a resume compared to larger projects.

SNEK (Snake Game again)
	•	Project Summary: Another Snake game (“SNEK”) implemented (the description says remake of classic Snake) ￼. Possibly the same as GameBoy Snake but maybe in pure JS or a different style.
	•	Assessment: Already covered Snake; likely not needed to repeat.

Dsxyliea
	•	Project Summary: A web page that constantly shuffles text on your browser ￼, simulating the experience of dyslexia for awareness (there’s a known project “Dsxyliea” that jumbles letters).
	•	Technologies Used: JavaScript injected into pages to randomly reorder letters within words (but keep first/last letter same, as many dyslexia simulations do). Possibly a Chrome extension or userscript that actively scrambles text on websites.
	•	Notable Features: If it’s an extension, it can toggle on/off the effect. The challenge is applying it to all text nodes on a page continuously (performance consideration).
	•	Contributions: Implemented the scrambling algorithm and applied it across DOM elements while preserving tags and not messing up input fields perhaps. Showed sensitivity to an important accessibility topic (though this is more for others to experience how dyslexic readers might see text).
	•	Assessment: Interesting concept project. It’s simple but with a meaningful goal (education about dyslexia). If Vaporjawn created an extension to do this, it’s a thoughtful project demonstrating both technical and social awareness. On a resume, it could be a small line like “Developed a Chrome extension to simulate dyslexic reading by shuffling letters on webpages (for empathy training).” It’s a unique project that stands out more than yet another to-do app, though technically not complex beyond string manipulation and DOM traversal.

Checkers
	•	Project Summary: Checkers game in HTML5/JS ￼. Implements the board game with drag-and-drop or click moves. Possibly only two-player on same machine (no AI mentioned).
	•	Technologies Used: HTML5 Canvas or DOM for board, CSS for styling pieces, JS for game rules (movement, capturing, kinging). jQuery might have been used for easier DOM if not canvas.
	•	Notable Features: Full implementation of checkers rules, including forced captures and king promotion. Maybe highlights moves. A challenging part is managing game state and enforcing rules properly.
	•	Contributions: Programmed move validation (can only move diagonally forward, unless king then both ways; must capture if possible, etc.), toggling turns, and rendering updates to the board. Possibly implemented victory detection. If well-done, it’s a decent board game implementation.
	•	Assessment: Moderate complexity web game. It’s more complex than TicTacToe due to more rules. For a resume, if applying for game dev or demonstrating ability to handle complex logic on front-end, it could be mentioned. Otherwise, it’s one of many projects and might be skipped for brevity, as higher-impact ones are available.

Mock-Store
	•	Project Summary: A UI skeleton for a software store ￼. Possibly a front-end prototype of an app store or e-commerce site (maybe showing product listing, cart UI without real backend).
	•	Technologies Used: HTML/CSS for layout (cards, product grid), maybe a bit of JS for interaction (tabs or filtering). Could be static mockups of pages.
	•	Notable Features: Focus on UI/UX rather than functionality – maybe responsive design, use of a CSS framework, placeholder images/text.
	•	Contributions: Created the design of the store pages (home, product detail, checkout, etc.) without actual purchase logic. Possibly used this to demonstrate front-end skills in styling and layout.
	•	Assessment: UI design exercise. If the role requires strong front-end design skills, one could reference having built high-fidelity mock UIs like this. Otherwise, without backend or unique functionality, it’s not a key project to list.

Drexel-Transportation-Javascript
	•	Project Summary: This appears to be a project related to a bus transportation system, possibly a bus tracking or seat allocation system (the GitHub Topics hint at javascript, mysql, json, sql, system, bus, transportation) ￼. It might be a prototype created during a hackathon (maybe at Drexel University) for a smarter bus system (the topic combination suggests a web app with a MySQL database for transit data).
	•	Technologies Used: Front-end: JavaScript. Back-end: likely a MySQL database with some server-side (could be PHP or Node, not clearly specified, but presence of SQL and JSON tags means data exchange between JS and DB). Possibly implemented some REST API to get bus info in JSON.
	•	Notable Features: Could include route tracking, digital ticket reservations, seat allocations, etc., as one might propose in a smart transport project. Since it’s likely incomplete (just a student project), maybe it set up a database schema (for buses, routes, users) and a basic web interface to simulate booking a seat or tracking bus location.
	•	Contributions: Collaborated (maybe in a team) to design a system architecture: set up a MySQL schema, wrote some SQL queries or a backend to provide data, and created a front-end to display or input info (like a schedule or a booking form). Possibly integrated Google Maps API for route mapping if ambitious.
	•	Assessment: Possibly a hackathon project – partial implementation. If it was a major project undertaken (and Vaporjawn’s involvement was significant), it can be mentioned to illustrate database and full-stack skills. But given the lack of README detail, it might not be fully realized. If described, focus on what was accomplished: “Developed a prototype web app for a bus transportation system with a MySQL database and JS front-end, allowing digital ticket reservations and displaying bus routes.” That shows system design thinking and ability to work with databases and front-end together. Ensure to clarify it was a concept/prototype if it wasn’t fully functional.

Evidence.zip
	•	Project Summary: A collection of posts considered significant by someone (Mike Haggar, per description) ￼. Possibly related to Smash Bros Melee community (since tags mention smash, melee, etc.), maybe an archive of evidence in a community controversy. Not code, just documents.
	•	Assessment: Not a software project. Skip.

Prime-Number-Finder-Java
	•	Project Summary: A Java version of prime finder ￼. Similar aim as the Rust one, but in Java. Likely less emphasis on performance, more on functionality. Possibly a simple console that prints primes up to N.
	•	Technologies Used: Java. No fancy frameworks; probably just uses loops.
	•	Notable Features: Straightforward prime check or sieve. Possibly an exercise in using Java collections or threads (though unlikely for something like this).
	•	Assessment: Basic programming exercise. Already have primes in Rust which is more interesting (due to Rust). The Java one doesn’t add much value to mention.

8-Queens-Python-Version
	•	Project Summary: Solving the 8-Queens problem (placing 8 queens on chessboard so none can attack each other) in Python ￼. This is a classic backtracking problem.
	•	Technologies Used: Python, likely just recursion/backtracking, maybe printing one solution. Possibly did both solver and visual text output of the board.
	•	Notable Features: Finds all solutions or one solution to 8-Queens. Could also be generalized to N-Queens if coded flexibly.
	•	Contributions: Implemented recursion to place queens row by row, checking constraints. Possibly used a bit of optimization (pruning, etc.).
	•	Assessment: Standard algorithm practice. Good to show algorithmic skill but commonly known problem. If needed to demonstrate familiarity with backtracking, one could mention it alongside Sudoku solver or others rather than as a separate project entry.

Trump-Blocker
	•	Project Summary: A browser extension or script that blocks content related to a certain topic (“Trump”) from being seen in the web browser ￼. Likely filters out mentions of “Donald Trump” on webpages or in social media feeds to avoid seeing that content.
	•	Technologies Used: Possibly a Chrome extension or userscript that finds keywords in the DOM and removes those elements. The tags include chrome-extension, Trump ￼, indicating a Chrome extension specifically.
	•	Notable Features: Provides content filtering on the client side. For example, on news sites or Facebook/Twitter, posts containing “Trump” would be hidden or blurred. Could allow the user to specify additional blocked keywords. It’s an example of a custom content filter.
	•	Contributions: Implemented the logic to scan page text for forbidden keywords and then either remove or collapse those elements. Handled continuously loading content (especially on infinite scroll platforms) by using mutation observers or timers to repeatedly filter new content. Created an extension UI if any (maybe a simple on/off toggle or keyword list).
	•	Assessment: Shows ability to manipulate web content and address user preferences. While politically themed, technically it’s akin to an adblock or content filter which is a legitimate skill (text processing, DOM manipulation at scale). It might be worth mentioning in context of having built custom browser extensions with filtering logic. Given it’s sensitive/political, on a resume one could generalize it: “Developed a Chrome extension to filter out user-specified keywords from webpages in real-time.” That emphasizes the technical aspect over the specific content.

Flappy-O
	•	Project Summary: A Flappy Bird clone (called “Flappy-O”) using only HTML/CSS/JS ￼. Flappy Bird is a well-known simple game (fly a bird through gaps between pipes by clicking to flap).
	•	Technologies Used: Canvas or DOM for rendering, JavaScript for game loop and physics (gravity, jump impulse, collision detection with pipes).
	•	Notable Features: Recreates the gameplay of a popular mobile game in the browser. Key points: smooth motion, consistent difficulty progression, collision accuracy. Possibly uses sprite images for the bird and pipes, or simple colored rectangles to represent them.
	•	Contributions: Implemented the physics (gravity pulling the bird down, jump velocity on click), random pipe generation, scoring mechanism, and game over conditions. Optimized for performance to avoid stutters, and maybe added a restart feature. Achieving a balanced difficulty and responsive controls is part of the work.
	•	Assessment: Great as a fun portfolio piece, not unique but shows game dev interest. Flappy Bird clones are a common exercise, but completing one demonstrates understanding of basic game loops and collision math. It’s more involved than TicTacToe or Hangman in real-time aspect. If space allows and role might appreciate game dev or interactive JS, mention it. Otherwise, it’s optional since other projects cover technical breadth more.

Overall Resume Inclusion Advice: Vaporjawn’s GitHub showcases many projects, but not all are worth equal emphasis. For a strong resume, focus on 5–7 significant projects that best demonstrate desired skills:
	•	File Encryptor – highlights full-stack desktop app development and security focus.
	•	Background Sounds – showcases React, audio handling, and complete app polish.
	•	Orderbook Synchronization – demonstrates real-time data handling and React prowess.
	•	Snapple-Facts (NPM Package) – shows back-end/data skills, testing, and publication.
	•	Screen Recorder & YouTube-to-MP3 (or Discord Music Bot) – demonstrate integration with OS or external APIs and handling of media/streams.
	•	Spell-Checker or Sudoku Solver – highlight algorithmic and Python capabilities.
	•	Personal Website – (minor, but shows front-end design and personal branding).

Less developed or forked items (Discord themes/plugins, trivial games, school assignments) can be omitted or briefly summarized as “additional smaller projects” if needed. Quality trumps quantity – it’s better to deeply discuss a few strong projects that cover a broad skill set than to list everything.
