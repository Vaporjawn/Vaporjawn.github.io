          Vaporjawn was never intended to be as big as it became. The instagram
          account actually started out as a private instagram account where I
          would be able to post more personal content. I started out with a few
          posts here and there, but then I had encountered a big problem. The
          camera on my iPhone 6S Plus, at the time, ceased to function at all;
          on both sides.

          <br />
          At a crossroads, I was faced with either uploading screenshots that I
          had of pictures around the internet or creating my own instagram
          content entirely. Obviously I chose the latter. After making my
          initial vaporwave posts my followers influenced me to make my account
          public and it quickly grew along with requests and commissions.
